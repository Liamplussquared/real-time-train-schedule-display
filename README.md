# real-time-train-schedule-display
A program that can fetch this realtime xml feed for a chosen stop, parses it and displays the train times in a more readable tabular form.

Used the response python library to make a GET request to the resource and the xml library to parse the response. The HTML for a simple table presenting the data is created.
